    "content": "A website is a space on the internet where people can explore, learn, watch, read, and interact with content. It's like a digital home made of connected web pages, each one holding different pieces of information. These can include text, photos, videos, buttons, forms, and links that lead you to more content. The first page of most websites is called the homepage. It's like the front door that welcomes visitors and tells them what the site is about. Websites serve many purposes. Some are made to share ideas or stories, educate or explain topics, show creative work or class projects, promote school clubs or events, or sell products or services. For example, your school's website might have sections like About Us for school history, Gallery to show event photos, and Contact to reach teachers or staff. Today, websites can be built using code like HTML and CSS, or by using AI tools that build the structure for you based on what you describe in a prompt. That means you don't need to be a programmer to make your own website, just someone with an idea to share. In short, a website is your voice on the internet, a place to express, create, and connect with others.",

    "content": "Learning to build websites helps students become creators, not just consumers of the internet. Instead of only browsing YouTube, reading blogs, or scrolling social media, students who build websites actually create the content others see online. A website is like a digital notebook or personal project space that can be shared with the world. You can use it to show off your school projects or art, share your thoughts, hobbies, or stories, or create something useful for your club, school, or community. But it's not just about the website itself, it's about the skills you gain. You learn to organize ideas clearly by deciding what goes where, how to group information, and how to make the content flow well. You make design decisions by choosing colors, fonts, layouts, and images to match your topic and style. You develop problem-solving and creative thinking by figuring out how to turn your vision into something real and easy to use. You practice digital communication as writing for websites helps you explain ideas in a way that others can understand quickly. These skills go beyond just tech, they help in every part of life including doing better in school presentations, creating digital portfolios for college, and preparing for careers in design, coding, journalism, or business. Whether you want to be a coder, a teacher, a business owner, or an artist, knowing how to build websites gives you a powerful edge in today's world.",

    "content": "Artificial Intelligence has made website building faster, easier, and more creative, even for students who have never coded before. Instead of writing long lines of HTML or CSS, students can now use AI-powered website builders like Lovable AI and WIX AI. These tools act like digital assistants that understand your instructions and build a full website for you. AI website builders work using a simple idea. You describe what you want, and the AI creates the website for you. This description is called a prompt. It can be one sentence or a short paragraph explaining the purpose, style, and sections of your website. For example, if you type Create a website for a school science club with a homepage, gallery, project section, and contact page, the AI will automatically choose the layout by deciding how the different parts of the website should be arranged, like where the title goes, where images should be placed, and how the sections flow. It selects colors and fonts, picking a visual theme that matches the project's purpose. For a science club, it might choose clean, modern colors and sharp fonts. The AI adds sample text and images, filling in the site with placeholders or example content so students can visualize the final look. It creates all the sections including a homepage, about section, gallery or project page, contact page, and footer area. This is known as no-code website building, because the student never has to write any code manually. The AI handles the technical work, while the student focuses on creativity and structure.",

It sits at the very top of every page and acts like a signpost that tells visitors where they are. A good header usually includes the website name, logo, or brand title, a navigation bar or menu with links to key pages like Home, About, and Contact, sometimes a banner image or a message like Welcome to Our Site, and a call to action such as Join Now, Start Here, or Explore More. The header helps users immediately know what your site is about and how to move around it. It's the digital equivalent of a front door and signboard.",

When you write a prompt for an AI website builder like Lovable AI or WIX AI, you are telling the AI what kind of website you want, what it should look like, what pages or sections it should include, and what style, colors, or mood you prefer. The AI reads your prompt and uses it to automatically generate a website. This is why writing a clear and specific prompt is one of the most important skills in AI-based website creation. AI tools are powerful, but they don't read minds. They only understand the words you give them. A strong prompt helps the AI choose the right layout, pick suitable images, prepare the right number of sections, match the style you imagined, and create a website that fits your purpose. A weak or vague prompt gives the AI very little to work with, so the website may look random or incomplete.",

    "content": "A well-designed website helps visitors feel comfortable, stay longer, and find information easily. Good design isn't about being flashy, it's about being clear, consistent, and user-friendly. There are five simple principles students should follow. First, keep it clean and simple. Too much text or too many images make a site look crowded. Use spacing to separate content clearly so it's easy to read and scroll through. Second, use readable fonts. Choose fonts that are easy to read on screens. Avoid overly decorative fonts for body text. Clear fonts help everyone, including younger users or people with vision challenges. Third, pick smart colors. Colors should match the topic and be easy on the eyes. Use high contrast like dark text on a light background so nothing is hard to read. Fourth, stay consistent. Use the same font types, sizes, and color styles throughout your site. Consistency makes your website look professional and organized. Fifth, use visuals that support your content. Photos, icons, or videos make the site more fun and engaging. But don't overdo it. Make sure every visual matches your message and doesn't distract the reader.",

This kind of design is called accessible design or inclusive design. Just like buildings need ramps and elevators to help people with different abilities, websites also need to be designed in a way that works for all kinds of users, including those who use screen readers, can't see colors well, or have difficulty clicking small buttons. Creating accessible websites shows kindness, awareness, and fairness. It helps more people access information, enjoy your content, and feel included.",

    "summary": "Making websites accessible involves using clear fonts, high contrast colors, alt text for images, avoiding flashing graphics, and creating descriptive links.",
    "content": "There are several ways to make a website more accessible. First, use clear and large fonts. Small or overly fancy fonts are hard to read, especially for people with vision issues or learning difficulties. Stick to simple, readable fonts like Arial, Verdana, or Roboto, and use a comfortable size, usually 16 pixels or more. Second, keep high contrast between text and background. If the text and background colors are too similar like gray on white, it's hard to read. High contrast means using dark text on a light background or light text on a dark background. This helps everyone, not just those with low vision or color blindness. Third, add alt text to all images. Alt text is a short description of what an image shows. People who use screen readers, which are software that read webpages out loud, rely on alt text to understand the image. For example, instead of just showing a picture of a robot, write Student presenting a robot built in science class. Fourth, avoid flashing or moving graphics. Fast-flashing or blinking visuals can cause discomfort or even health issues like seizures in some people. Keep animations smooth and optional. Let users control them if possible. Fifth, make links descriptive. Don't just say Click here. Instead, be specific like Download the school schedule PDF or See the list of finalists. This helps screen reader users know exactly what a link will do.",

When you design a website, think beyond yourself. Ask questions like Can everyone read this, Would someone with a vision problem understand this image, and Can a person using only a keyboard navigate this site. Being accessible is about being respectful, thoughtful, and fair, making sure everyone has equal access to information. A website that welcomes everyone is a website that represents the best of you.",

Look at each section to confirm there are no typos or missing images. Test it on a phone to make sure the site still looks good and works well. Check for private info to ensure you're not sharing your full name, home address, or personal photos. See if the footer looks complete by adding your project name, credits, or your class if needed. This step is like proofreading your final draft before submitting an assignment. It shows that you care about quality and safety.",
